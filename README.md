I would prefer not to post the dataset used for the sake of privacy. However, all the functions that I used to create the dataset and analyze the dataset are provided within bot.py

For the sake of convenience, I also ended up viewing all the graphs through the discord bot as well. However, one could also add a plt.show() line and remove the lines that attempt to create a file and send that file through a discord bot if trying to view the graphs.
